# ðŸ“¹ TF Models Capture for Jetson

Capture training data using Jetson's camera (e.g. `nvarguscamerasrc`) with OpenCV and GStreamer â€” optimized for TensorFlow models like EfficientDet or SSD.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Jetson Orin Nano)

### 1. Open terminal and clone the repo
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/Trung78z/tf-models-capture.git
```

### 2. Move to the correct directory
```bash
mv tf-models-capture datasets
cd datasets
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
make install
```

### 4. Run the capture program
```bash
make run
```

Captured data will be saved in `datasets/collects/`.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
datasets/
â”œâ”€â”€ collects/           # Captured video/images
â”œâ”€â”€ script.sh           # Startup wrapper
â”œâ”€â”€ capture             # Compiled C++ capture binary

## ðŸ’¡ Tip

To auto-run on boot with systemd, use the following service file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Capture Autostart
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/jetson/Desktop/datasets/script.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/jetson/Desktop/datasets/collects
User=jetson
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
